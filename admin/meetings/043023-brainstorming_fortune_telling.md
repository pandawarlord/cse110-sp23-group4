## Agenda
___
1. Cover Research ([Mira Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMOc-kq0=/))
   - Do we have any more ideas of types of fortune telling?
     - Chinese Chi chi Sticks 
       - Physically shaking the phone 
     - Korean Face Telling
       - Pseudoscience
       - Face scanning
     - Omikuji
       - Japanese fortune telling tradition
       - Draw a scroll from a drawer
       - Similar to 8-ball
     - Tarot cards
       - Tarot card reader interprets the cards meaning 
       - Very flexible as it is up to the card reader. 
         - But also not easy to effectively connect so many cards together.
     - Turkish Coffee
       - Drink a cup of coffee and turn it upside down. 
     - Tea Leaf Readings (Tasseography)
       - Very abstract 
     - Parakeet Astrology
       - Parrot selects a card that represents symbols from Indian astrology and deities. 
   - What do we want to do?
     - Do we want something deterministic or non-deterministic? 
       - Non pre-determined answers
         - AI, APIs, re-word responses somehow 
         - We don't want repetitive answers 
     - Types of fortune telling 
       - Ask a question, give an answer
       - Check compatability (i.e: matching couples, etc)
     - Image recognition vs Cards
       - Image recognition
         - Might be difficult
         - Perhaps have pseudo "image recognition" instead of real recognition. 
       - Tarot cards
         - Might be more practical
         - Can create animations
     - **DECISION: CARD READING (of some form)**
       - Because... 
         - might be more practical in time constraints
         - still gives us a lot of flexibility 
  
   - What is our main feature of the project? (Maybe we discuss this later)

2. TODO
   - By **Tuesday night**
   - Each person comes up with the following: 
     -  1 User case / User stories
     -  2 Features 
        -  Draw rough picture 
        -  Explanation
