     - Most have a deck of cards as the fortune telling methodology
2. Continue App Brainstorm

   - Categorize the fortune (love, education, life)
     - Other ideas: CSE 110, Powell's "thoughts" about you, group projects
   - **CRUD ASPECT!!!**
   - Features
     - Spread out cards in a line
3. Hone in on App Design

   - ADRs
     - No open ended questions, we will output a fortune based off of the category they choose
       - Why: Too difficult to control user behavior and tailor answers based off of open ended questions
4. Decide on MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
   - Landing Page
     - Displays all the options for categories
   - Fortune Bank Page
     - Bank of saving all the users fortunes (category, reading, and date)
   - Fortune Page
     -
   - Theme
     - In a fortune tellers shop
     - Each category changes the background
   - Features
     - We have categories of fortunes that a user can choose from
     - User picks *x* amount of cards
     - Our app "reads" the cards and delivers the fortune with some degree of ceremony
   - Nice to have stuff
     - Give user the choice to answer yes/no questions to skew results
5. Distribute Tasks
   - Core coding team
   - Documentation Team
   - Testing Team
   - At-Large Team (utility players)
