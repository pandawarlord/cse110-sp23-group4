### Mad Sad Glad 

**MAD** <br>
- Need to set up a testing process for Jest and Puppeteer tests in our CI/CD 
  pipeling ASAP
- JSDOCS needs to be finalized and an ADR needs to be written for how to generate the docs
- There isn't a cohesive and unified form of styling the page, need to decide on fonts for the entire page and some buttons here and there
- Some people very assigned very easy tasks ad didn't do that much work while some people did a lot of work
- Some of the task assignements weren't very clear

**SAD** <br>
- Sad that we were not able to write tests for all of the pages before the end of last sprint, something that we need to do for next soring
- Sad that some communication wasn't being made between partners and not everyone was on the same page as much as last time

**GLAD** <br>
- the organization of the github repository is very good including the design of the issues and the use of pull requests
- communications from leaders and standusps were ver clearn and effective
- Making very good progress of the visual aspects of the app and it looks very good
- The produce prototype finally has full functionality and it can barely be used a fortune telling app
- Lots of code is finally coming together and everything is working so far
