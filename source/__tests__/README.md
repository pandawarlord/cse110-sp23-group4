# Testing FAQ
If you're having trouble running the tests, try the following:

From the root directory:
- run -> `npm install`

- RUN -> `npm i puppeteer@20.4.0`
- Run -> `npm i chromium`
- `cd ./node_modules/puppeteer`
- run -> `npm install`
- restart your vscode
- make sure you're using the latest version of node (`node alias default node`)
- `npm run test`
