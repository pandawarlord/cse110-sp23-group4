        Deep in the forest, hidden amongst the trees is a hut that possesses powers to foresee the future.
        Legend says that all who enter, discover something new about themselves. Some walk away with renewed hope... others with crushed dreams.
        As you get closer, a rustic, old voice beckons, "Come in, my child!"
