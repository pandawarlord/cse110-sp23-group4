***NOT A FINAL VERSION***
<br>
*See below requirements for specific details. Please also bear with the amount of times 'mystical' is mentioned*

<br>

## 8-Ball Page Layout Overview
---
- title of project (Ex. 'MYSTICAL 8BALL') at the very top
- viewport background is image of "mystical" setting
- 8-Ball properly placed according to background image setting (Ex. background image has a fortune teller with arms outstretched, 8-Ball placed underneath hands)
- input question box placed directly above 8-Ball
- output answer should appear in the middle of 8-Ball

<br>

### Visual Assets (Samuel, Christian, Abijit, Brandon, Khanh)
---
- title of project should have stylish font in accordance with color scheme of background
- 8-Ball should be "mystical" and styled to fit the background image
- output answer box should be styled according to 8-Ball and should look relatively natural on the 8-Ball
- input answer box should also be styled according to 8-Ball design
- "button" should be either the 8-Ball itself or invisible button overlayed on top of 8-Ball, change 8-ball appearance slightly when hovered over

<br>

### Basic 8-Ball Functionality (Joshua, Nakul)
---
- should not let user input a blank question
- when button is pressed, one random 8-Ball response should appear in 8-Ball output text area
- create a few tests (if possible) to test functionality

<br>

### Animations (Joshua, Helen, Ezgi, Nakul, Michi)
---
- have clouds of smoke float across the screen endlessly
- when the 8-Ball button is pressed, 8-ball should glow (start with one color for simplicity) and produce 'mystical' sounds for a period of time before displaying answer (Coordinate with 8-Ball asset designer)
- when answer is displayed, it should appear that it is being typed if possible (similar to how ChatGPT displays answers)
- have 8-Ball answer outputted as voice message (if possible)
