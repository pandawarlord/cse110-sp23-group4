# Presentation/Documentation for 8 Ball Project
For all Google Drive links, please use your **UCSD** emails!

## Presentation
The presentation link is here. If you worked on a feature of our 8-ball, please create a slide. I have created a template slide.  Please duplicate it and add how you used AI in your code generation and your personal pros and cons of working with AI. In the title, I think putting your name will suffice.
