# 8 Ball Demo Video Script
This video will be a *short* video (2-3 min?) that demonstrates the app. Brandon will probably record this video via Zoom recording. Wordcounter has the script at 1 min 28 sec so whole video will probably be about 2 min?

**THIS IS A WORKING DRAFT**

## Script

*Begin on our team's webpage*

This is the 8-ball demo for Team 4, The Powell Rangers. The goal of our 8-ball was to create a web app that not only satisfies the basic requirements for an 8-ball, but also add a sense of mysticism, wonder, and credibility that is often attributed to fortune telling.

The basics of an 8-ball work as specified. A user is prompted to input their question.

*Write "Will my day go well?" in the input questions box*

Instead of hitting a submit button, we decided to simulate "shaking" a magic 8-ball in our web app. In order to receive the answer to their question, the user must "shake" the magic 8-ball with their mouse.

*Shake the 8-ball*

 In addition to outputting an answer in our 8-ball design, which was inspired from the look of traditional 8-balls, the answer is displayed in a typed out fashion similar to ChatGPT. Furthermore, the answer is vocalized in a voice message. Let's do a full run through to see all these features working together.

 *Do a full demo of the 8-ball by typing in the question Will the Powell Rangers succeed in CSE 110?*

We also check to ensure that user types in a question before they shake the 8-ball. If  a user were not to input a question, this is what will happen.

*Do a demo with an empty question field*

We also made the input box adjustable.

*Demonstrate how the input box can be adjusted*

From a visual aspect, you will notice that we went for a mystical or Delphic aesthetic. We used AI to generate the warm ethereal background and modeled our UI choices from the text to the 8-ball around the AI-generated image. Animated clouds also endlessly float around our page, adding to the mysticism our 8-ball app is centered around. Furthermore, users are treated to a soft soothing background track that adds a sense of calm and safety with our 8-ball. This track is trigged as soon as a user clicks on the webpage

*Do a demo of the background music beginning*

Overall, our team accomplished almost all the features proposed in our original brainstorm. Thank you for watching this demo!
