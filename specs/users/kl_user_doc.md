# Personas
This user wants to use this app for fun and make predictions for his friends or even himself and may even help make their decisions such as
- should so and so go talk to their crush
- what should we have for dinner tonight
- would it be a wise decision to study all night or should I sleep before tomorrow's exam

# Features
If we are going with the card reading fortune telling I think a fun little feature would be to have a shuffle button that shuffles the presented cards for the user.

Another potential feature could be to mulligan a card where if they have a bad feeling about a card they can replace it with a new one
